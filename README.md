[Cracking the Coding Interview, 6th Edition](http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/) solutions in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/).

## Running

The whole project is set up as a module, so it can be easily imported as an external crate. To run all tests, run

	cargo test

in the project's root directory.

## Contributing

I'm currently not accepting pull requests. This is a personal exercise to learn Rust and prepare for interviews. I might accept contributions later.
